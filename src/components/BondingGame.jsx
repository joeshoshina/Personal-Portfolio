                  Bonding Game is designed to help couples ask bold and
                  meaningful questions without feeling vulnerableâ€”using the card
                  format as a lighthearted excuse to explore deeper topics. The
                  game encourages connection, strengthens relationships, and
                  makes getting to know each other fun and exciting. It features
                  three themes: Perception, Connection, and Reflection. Each
                  theme includes 30 unique questions that are shuffled and
                  presented as a randomized stack.

                  This project was a significant learning experience, where I
                  gained skills in the React ecosystem (React, Vite, JSX) and
                  best practices for component structure and state management
                  using hooks like useState and useEffect. I learned to
                  structure and update objects in state efficiently and how to
                  implement data structures like stacks in a React-friendly way.
                  Additionally, I gained confidence in using Git for version
                  control, styling with CSS and TailwindCSS, and breaking down
                  tasks into smaller, manageable steps to build scalable
                  solutions.

                      are used.
